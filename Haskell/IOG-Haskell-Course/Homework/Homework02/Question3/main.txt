Defining type signatures for variables is also a best practice in Haskell, as it can help to make the code more robust, readable and maintainable. Here are some benefits of defining type signatures for variables:

Type signatures can help to ensure that the variable is used consistently and correctly throughout the program. By specifying the type of a variable, the compiler can catch any type errors that may occur when the variable is used with an incompatible value or function.

Type signatures make the code more readable and easier to understand. When reading the code, a well-written type signature can provide important information about the variable's role and what kind of values it is supposed to hold.

Type signatures can serve as a form of documentation. By providing a type signature for a variable, you are explicitly stating what type of value the variable is intended to hold, which can help others who read your code to understand how to use it correctly.

Type signatures can improve code reusability. By specifying the types of variables, you enable other programmers to reuse your code with confidence, knowing what types of values the variables expect.

Type signatures can help in reasoning about the variable behavior. It's easy to understand the role of the variable and its values by looking at the type signature.

Overall, providing type signatures for variables is a good practice in Haskell, as it can help to make the code more robust, readable and maintainable.
