-- Day 2

{- 
Write a function 'isPalindrome' that takes a list of elements
and returns 'true' if the list is a palindrome' 

TO DO / Questions For Today: 
What is a function and how do I make one? 



How do I turn a string into a list?

import Data.List.Split

main :: IO ()
main = do

putStrLn "Enter a word, this program will check it it is a palindrome!"




if c == b then putStrLn "It's a palindrome!"
    else putStrLn "Yeah, it's not a palindrome"
