1. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns their sum.
   Example: sum [1, 2, 3] should return 6.

2. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all even numbers doubled.
   Example: doubleEvens [1, 2, 3, 4] should return [2, 4, 6, 8].

3. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with only the odd numbers.
   Example: filterOdds [1, 2, 3, 4] should return [1, 3].

4. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the largest number in the list.
   Example: maxNumber [1, 2, 3, 4] should return 4.

5. Write a function that takes two lists of integers and returns a new list with the elements of the first list followed by the elements of the second list.
   Example: concatLists [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
